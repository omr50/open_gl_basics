- how do vertex buffer objects work
- how do vertex array objects work
- how does the state machine work
- how to keep a mental model to properly understand why things are needed
- why do we need to represent the data as consecutive arrays using attribs
- what exactly are attribs
- look into the code where we have the vao and vab and why is there multiple (array)
  (basically how is it used)
